Initial release.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Default settings =

When activated this plugin will restore the previous ("classic") WordPress editor and hide the new block editor ("Gutenberg").
These settings can be changed at the Relive Classic => Classic Editor and Classic Widgets screen.

= Why does Classic Editor plugin have way more users? =

Because it is being promoted by the Gutenberg developers and the “official” plugin for replacing Gutenberg. That’s fine, but understand that Disable Gutenberg functions the same way AND provides way more features and settings. 

= How to disable default Gutenberg frontend styles? =

To enable/disable the styles, visit the plugin setting, “Disable frontend Gutenberg stylesheet”.

= Why Classic Editor and Disable Gutenberg? =

The original Visual Editor was awesome. I've been using the original/classic editor for over 10 years now and the experience has always been 100% smooth. I've tried Gutenberg and yes, it's much better now than previous versions, but for me it's not as comfortable or streamlined as the classic editor. So I think a lot of people, like me, are familiar with that and want to use it for a long time.
